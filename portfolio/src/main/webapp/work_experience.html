            <p>During my freshman year of college, the resource that I found most helpful were upper classman that were willing to share their experience. Once I became a junior, I wanted to give back and so I started working as an engineering learning assistant to help new students with the adjustment to college life. I was soon promoted to Lead Engineering Learning Assistant for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Depatment.</p>

            <p>I spent the summer between my sophomore and junior year of college interning for Amazon in Seattle, Washington. I worked in the eCommerce Foundation where my team was responsable for the software used to process the data created by each transaction made on Amazon.com. I plan to return to Amazon this summer, but will be working in Irvine, California.</p>
