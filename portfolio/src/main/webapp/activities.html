                <p>I made my first skydive on July 7, 2017 and fell in love 
                    with it immediately. By August 2017 I had earned my 
                    skydiving license and try to go skydiving whenever 
                    I can. I currently serve as the Vice President for the 
                    Falling Illini Skydiving Club.</p>

                    want to try skydiving, check out the Falling Illini

                <p>I started playing quidditch as a way to stay active, but 
                    quickly made my way onto the school team and now travel 
                    across the country playing against other colleges. Since
                     joining, the Ridgebacks have qualified for the National
                      Championships twice. My primary position is chaser, 
                      but I have also played as a seeker.</p>
